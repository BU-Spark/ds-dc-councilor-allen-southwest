The data provide insights into the socio-economic status of the residents in Census Tract 64. The household income data gives an idea of the income levels of the residents, while the monthly housing cost data provides information on the housing affordability of the residents.

Combining the two sets of data, we can infer that a significant portion of the renter-occupied housing units fall under the lower income categories, and many of them have to bear a significant monthly housing cost burden. On the other hand, a significant portion of the owner-occupied housing units fall under higher income categories, and many of them have higher monthly housing costs but can afford them.

From the data provided, we can observe the following:
* Census Tract 64 in District of Columbia has a higher percentage of owner-occupied housing units compared to Census Tract 102.01, which has a higher percentage of renter-occupied housing units.
* In Census Tract 64, District of Columbia, the majority of owner-occupied housing units have monthly housing costs between $1,500 to $2,999, while the majority of renter-occupied housing units have monthly housing costs between $500 to $1,499.
* In Census Tract 102.01, District of Columbia, the majority of owner-occupied housing units have monthly housing costs between $1,500 to $1,999, while the majority of renter-occupied housing units have monthly housing costs between $2,000 to $2,499.
* The household income distribution in both Census Tract 64 and Census Tract 102.01, District of Columbia, varies with Census Tract 102.01 having a higher percentage of households with incomes over $100,000 compared to Census Tract 64.
* There is missing data for the monthly housing costs for the highest income bracket in Census Tract 102.01, District of Columbia.

In Census Tract 102.01, which has a higher percentage of renter-occupied housing units, we can see that a significant proportion of households have a household income of $50,000 or more (32.9%) and $150,000 or more (32.9%). Meanwhile, 41.9% of owner-occupied housing units have monthly housing costs of $1,500 to $1,999.
In Census Tract 102.02, which has a more even distribution of renter-occupied and owner-occupied housing units, we can see that a significant proportion of households have a household income of $50,000 or more (39.1%) and $100,000 to $149,999 (30.1%). Additionally, 29.8% of owner-occupied housing units have monthly housing costs of $3,000 or more. On the other hand, a significant proportion of renter-occupied housing units have monthly housing costs of $1,000 to $1,499 (24.8%) and $500 to $799 (12.8%).
It's worth noting that there are some missing values in the data (NaN) for the percentage of owner-occupied housing units with monthly housing costs of $3,000 or more in Census Tract 102.02 and the percentage of renter-occupied housing units with no cash rent in Census Tract 102.01.

For owner-occupied housing units, the majority of households have an income of $150,000 or more (44.10%), followed by $100,000 to $149,999 (20.90%).
