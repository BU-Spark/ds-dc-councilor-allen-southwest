# Team 2 - Gun Violence in Southwest DC


## General Overview and Project Goal

The Southwest District has seen a lot of change in the last few years and certain areas have been completely overhauled (construction of wharf, stadiums, etc.). This has caused a clear distinction between the west and the east part of the district (specifically, Tracts 102 and 110 on the west, and Tract 64 and 105 on the east).
There also are 3 big public housing communities (Greenleaf Gardens, Syphax Gardens, and James Creek) in the east part of the Southwest District and this so called “neighborhood within a neighborhood” faces a lot of problems that are associated with generational poverty, such as high rates of unemployment, community violence, substance use, chronic disease, teen pregnancy, and food insecurity. 
The goal of this project is to provide a data dashboard which shows that these issues exist, so that these visualizations can be used as arguments to convince stakeholders in this district to aim for change. Furthermore, by analysing certain variables and inspecting correlations between them, we aim to detect underlying issues that perpetuate the issue of generational poverty so that decision-makers have an easier time approaching the task of improving the status-quo of this district.


## Team 2's Approach

While Team 1's focus is on Crime and Team 3's focus is on Education (primarily), Team 2 decided to tackle the other variables of interest to the clients. This means that we did not choose one specific topic and explored it in-depth, but rather that we focused on covering the bases. We picked broader variables and explored how they correlate with the issue of disparity and poverty.

## File Structure

We have one /deliverables folder in which all the final documents of our deliverables are (i.e. the products at different stages). This folder also contains our scrum reports.

We also have one /team2_work folder. This folder contains a subfolder for each member. Each member's subfolder contains three folders:
1. data: contains all the data that was used by member x
2. notebooks: contains all the jupyter notebooks/code that was used by member x. This is sometimes further divided by deliverables, in order to specfiy the work that was done at different stages of the process
3. plots: contains the plots that were created for the deliverables

Each member's subfolder also contains a .txt file that gives details on how that member's code can be run.
