From the previous findings, African Americans comprises the largest proportion of the population under poverty.
In this deliverable, it is clear the African Americans, and Hispanics, have a significantly lower tendency of moving within the same county (in this case, the Washington D.C.). Meanwhile, analysis on the demographical movement of the white population sees a uprising moving rate within D.C..
Also, there is a lower geographical movement percentage of residents in the low-income tract (Tract 64) compared to the ones in higher-income tracts.
It is possible to predict that , with demolising financial conditon, residents would fail to afford the life in those tracts with convenient while expensive QOL, and moving to tracts with lower cost of living. This explains why, though other tracts see a economical thrive in the last decades, the average income of the low-income tract (Tract 64) didn't benefit as much as others.
To make policy suggestions, it will be regionally benefitial for the local government to make infrastructure upgrade through districts to make moving from tracts to tracts indifferent. Furthermore, a deep analysis in the reasons and feedbacks of residents moving within the county is needed to be made for accurate policy decisions.
