NOTES ON THE GRAPHS:
The findings, by evaluating upon the income estimation of the households from the Southwest D.C. are:
-The majority of families in the region relies on earnings and wages for a living, while there are a few depends on social security or supplemental income,
which is quite minor compared to the average income as a whole 
-Most of the families have both spouses as the main work force to feed all the members of the family, while there are quite a few household depends solely on
a single worker, there are also some family with no employed members 
-Income varies more significantly between tracts to tracts over different races. (require further statisitical proof or analysis)
