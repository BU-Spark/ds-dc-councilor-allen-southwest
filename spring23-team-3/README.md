Team 3

## Project Description

Southwest DC is a neighborhood that since the 1950s and 1960s has seen drastic amounts of
gentrification. With it being the first location of "urban renewal", over 23,000 residents, most of
whom were Black, and 1,500 businesses were displaced. This destroyed a once thriving African
American community, with only 13% of the original population returning. Most of the new residents
that moved in were white and middle class.
The government began rebuilding in the 1970s, but redevelopment didn’t reach Southwest until the
2000s. Even still, Southwest faces challenges coming from concentrated generational poverty. The
area sees high rates of unemployment, community violence, substance use, chronic disease, teen
pregnancy, and food insecurity.
Our team has been tasked with creating data visualizations with a racial equity and economic mobility
lens that would help confirm this understanding of the neighborhood, provide a clear image of the
neighborhood’s challenges, resources, and disparities, and help define a path forward toward a more
equitable, inclusive, and thriving community.

_You must first register for an API key in order to use US census data. [Please register for one here](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html)_

## Education
You can see the important information regarding education within the 'Education Analysis' directory. All the CSV files that are needed to run the code are within 'Education Analysis/data'. All the generated plots are in 'Education Analysis/Plots'. To run the code, just open the 'Education Analysis.ipynb' file with either Jupyter, or Google Colab, and all of the cells should run without requiring any additional user effort.

The notebook and its outputs have also been saved as a PDF in 'EducationAnalysis_PDF.pdf'.

## Poverty

To run the notebook on economic vitality & unemployment analysis (dev2_S301 3.ipynb), download a CSV of table 'S2301' from the US Census website and make sure it is in the same directory as the notebook.

Working within the "PovertyAnalysis" directory, there is a cell on top of each notebook where one must place their API key. Afterwards, one can simply run each cell to see the visualizations.

## Economic Vitality
To run the notebook on poverty (deliverables/team-3_del2_poverty.ipynb), create an API key with the US census website at https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html . Set the first line API_SECRET_KEY = "YOUR KEY", and then run the rest of the jupyter notebook.

## Food Stamps
To run the notebook on Food Stamp, all the important information regarding food stamp is under the "delieverable" folder. All the CSV files that are needed to run the code re in the 'Remade.csv'. All the generated charts can be found in the file as well.

## Household Tenure
To run the notebook on Household Tenure, all the important information regarding House Tenure is under the "delieverable" folder. All the CSV files that are needed to run the code re in the 'delieverable3.csv'. All the generated charts can be found in the file as well.
